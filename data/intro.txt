Help Martin and Roger on their daily
patrol around space station "Lunar 1".
Never knowing what could happen today.
Sometimes meteroids,
sometimes space pirates,
sometimes both.
Due to limited resources on ammunition,
oxygen and fuel, they have to take
care how far they can go when in
struggle.
Avoid the worst case:
A decision between
the lesser of two evils:
A colliding maneuver with an enemy
or lost in space until all resources
are exhausted.
